career-profile:
    title: Research Description
    summary: |
      I am a computational biologist with a strong background in ageing research. I mainly used R programming language for the analysis of gene expression data from RNA-seq and microarrays. I am currently completing my PhD, which focused on gene expression convergence of tissues in ageing. I plan to continue working on the ageing research.
